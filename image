# Overwrite a device (or file) with an image file.  Minimize code run as root.
# Show progress.  Attempt to fail if the output target is mounted or otherwise
# in use.
#
# WARNING:  Detection of usage of the output target can fail.  There are a
# number of ways to be in use, and checking all of them may be impossible.  The
# policy of running as much code as possible as non-root may lead to more cases
# where detection fails.  Even if detection is perfect, there is still a race
# condition.  
# 
# The idea is that this script should stop you (me) from accidentally imaging
# the OS disk instead of a USB device on a single user desktop, especially when
# those targets have similar names, ie when the ordering of /dev/sda and
# /dev/sdb depend on whether you had a USB stick plugged in at boot time.  That
# case should fairly well handled, but you should still try to target the right
# device.  If your system is complex, multi-user, and/or unusually configured,
# unhandled problems are more likely, but the script should still be safer than
# just blasting the target with dd.
#
# It's like a safety net.  There are big holes, but I still feel better with it
# than without it.


# TODO:  Test intended failure conditions.

# TODO:  Research how effective it is to obtain a lock on a device file and
# whether this might remove the need for some other checking.

# TODO:  Check fstab for partitions (and label and UUID thereof) of the output
# target.  Research a way to list partitions to facilitate this.

# TODO:  Investigate lsblk for identifying relationships among partitions and
# devices.

# TODO:  Handle lack of read permissions for readlink.  Maybe write a wrapper
# function.

# TODO:  Fail if output the target is the subject of an ongoing direct read or
# write operation.

# TODO:  Decide whether to check whether arguments refer to extant files.

# TODO:  Research whether device mapper interacts directly with non-device
# files.  Adjust comments in check_device_mapper().
